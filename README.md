# jsbase

An implementation of coreutils in JavaScript.

**NOTE:** Please don't actually use these utilities, this is soley a way for me
to learn JavaScript that doesn't involve web programming.

Expect bad code, poor performance, and missing features

# Compiling

You'll need to have QuickJS installed, as that provides the JavaScript
compiler/runtime that these files use. This won't work on node.
You'll also need gnumake if you don't have it already (you probably do).

Just run `make`.
